# Doxyfile 1.7.2

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

# Note: For madlib, we want this to be a path relative to the repository root.

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES all private members of a class 
# will be included in the documentation.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = NO

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES all static members of a file 
# will be included in the documentation.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = NO

# The INTERNAL_DOCS tag determines if documentation 
# that is typed after a \internal command is included. If the tag is set 
# to NO (the default) then the documentation will be excluded. 
# Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.

INTERNAL_DOCS          = NO

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "User Documentation"

# If the sources in your project are distributed over multiple directories
# then setting the SHOW_DIRECTORIES tag to YES will show the directory hierarchy
# in the documentation. The default is NO.

SHOW_DIRECTORIES       = NO

# Set the SHOW_NAMESPACES tag to NO to disable the generation of the
# Namespaces page.
# This will remove the Namespaces entry from the Quick Index
# and from the Folder Tree View (if specified). The default is YES.

SHOW_NAMESPACES        = NO

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left
# blank the following patterns are tested:
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.d *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh
# *.hxx *.hpp *.h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs *.php *.php3 *.inc *.m *.mm *.dox *.py
# *.f90 *.f *.for *.vhd *.vhdl

FILE_PATTERNS          = *.dox \

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given extension.
# Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it using this
# tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and language
# is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript, CSharp, C,
# C++, D, PHP, Objective-C, Python, Fortran, VHDL, C, C++. For instance to make
# doxygen treat .inc files as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C
# (default is Fortran), use: inc=Fortran f=C. Note that for custom extensions
# you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise the files are not read by doxygen.

EXTENSION_MAPPING      = sql_in=C++ 

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories
# with spaces.

INPUT                  = @DOXYGEN_INPUT_USER@

# configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Enable the USE_MATHJAX option to render LaTeX formulas using MathJax
# (see http://www.mathjax.org) which uses client side Javascript for the
# rendering instead of using prerendered bitmaps. Use this if you do not
# have LaTeX installed or if you want to formulas look prettier in the HTML
# output. When enabled you also need to install MathJax separately and
# configure the path to it using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option.
